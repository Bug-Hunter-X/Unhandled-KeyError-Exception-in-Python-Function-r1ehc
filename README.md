This repository demonstrates a common Python bug: an unhandled KeyError exception.  The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code where an attempt is made to access a key in a dictionary without checking if it exists. This can lead to runtime errors. The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates the proper way to handle the exception using a `try-except` block, which prevents the program from crashing and gracefully handles the scenario when the key is missing.
